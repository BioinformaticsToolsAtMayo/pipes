## Key is the column name
## Type can be one of: Json, JsonArray, String, Float, Integer, Boolean
## Count is typically an integer to represent the exact number of values that can occur for a key.
##   If the type is Boolean, then count should be 0.  If a key always has one value it should be one.
##   If the number of values can vary, a dot ('.') should be used
