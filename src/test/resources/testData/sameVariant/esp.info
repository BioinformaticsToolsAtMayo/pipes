This is to test that even though there are two variants in the catalog at the following position,
bior_same_variant should only return the one that matches the ref and alt allele (the SNP), not the 
indel.  There was a bug previously that said since the RsId on both the incoming variant and the catalog variant
were ".", they were equal, and so there was no need to check the Ref and Alt, even though the Refs and Alts were different.
